    <p class="indent">
        Labrador is the name I've given to my homelab, a two-machine Proxmox cluster that runs various services that I use day to day. I use it mainly for media streaming and as a development environment, but I'm brushing over a lot of specifics that are all documented on the Github repository linked above.

    <p class="indent">
        Terminal-todo is a small program I wrote a while ago that uses Python to interact with .csv files and display them as nice tables. I used this for a long while as my primary method of tending a todo list until the addiction took hold and I wasn't bound to one laptop anymore.

    <p class="indent">
        Car Talk was a big part of my childhood, and I still listen to it fairly often today. Unfortunately, NPR's website isn't a great way to view the archive, and so this tool helps remedy that by transforming the backend requests into a logical format and plugging that into a frontend that allows you to access specific episodes without having to infinite scroll for several minutes.

    <p class="indent">
        This was one of my first big API projects, and I'm still pretty proud of it. It's a browser extension that adds a widget for weather at your location using <a href="weather.gov">weather.gov</a>'s free API. It suport unit conversion, gracefully handles missing information, and most importantly, allows you to change all of the colors.

    <h3><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/jenkinsjamesb/custom-ntp">custom NTP</a></h3>
    <p class="indent">
        There's not a whole lot to say about this one. It's a custom new tab page browser extension that provides a search bar and some frequently used links, again with fully-customizable colors and a fun weather option that adds rain or snow to the background.
